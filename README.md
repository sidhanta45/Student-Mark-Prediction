# Student-Mark-Prediction


	Developed a Student Mark Prediction System to forecast student scores based on study hours. Built a machine learning model (Linear Regression) using Python to analyze study patterns and predict performance.
 
 Designed and deployed an interactive Flask-based web application for real-time predictions. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify correlations between study hours and marks.
 
	Utilized scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Improved decision-making in academic performance assessment through data-driven insights.
